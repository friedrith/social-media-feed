## Getting started

yarn dev
```

## Technologies

This repository is based on:

- [next.js](https://nextjs.org/) (build: ssr, fast)
- [reactjs](https://reactjs.org/)
- [redux-toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) (less code than redux)
- [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)+[tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/)+[flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) (style+components)
- prettier + eslint (code style)
- [i18next](https://www.i18next.com/) (location)
- [jest](https://jestjs.io/) (test)
- [simple-git-hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks)
- [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
- github actions

## Roadmap

Some features are missing to have a complete user experience and a stable project:

- persisting session so the user is not required to log at each hard refresh (conflicts with next.js)
- improve test coverage: only few tests have been written to show the capabilities
- a release system?
