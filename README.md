## Getting started

```bash
yarn

yarn dev
```

## Technologies

This repository is based on:

- next.js (build: ssr, fast)
- react.js
- redux-toolkit (less code than redux)
- tailwind+[tailwindui](https://tailwindui.com/)+[flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) (style+components)
- prettier + style (code style)
- i18next (location)
- jest (test)
- simple-git-hooks
- commitlint
- github actions

## Roadmap

Some features are missing to have a complete user experience and a stable project:

- persisting session so the user is not required to log at each hard refresh (conflicts with next.js)
- improve test coverage: only few tests have been written to show the capabilities
